# Instructions

## Starting the Game
Go to Assets/Scenes, click MainMenu, and press play

## Goal
Get the player (red sphere) to the yellow orbs!

## Player Controls
Use the arrow keys to move the player. Careful the ground is slippery!

## Green Box Controls

Click on and drag the green boxes to build bridges and walkways.
Use WASD to rotate the boxes.

The dragging physics are a bit weird with screen-to-world coords (especially when pushing
  the boxes away from the camera). Just keep at it and it will work.

## If you get stuck...

The only real way to get stuck is if a green box falls over and is impossible
to rotate in a way that solves the puzzle. There are many ways to fix this.

1. Drop the green box off the edge, it will respawn with the correct orientation.
2. Pressing esc will reload the current scene.
3. Rolling the player off the edge also reloads the current scene.

## Tips

When stacking boxes (level 2), it can be helpful to drop and then click on the stacked box before it fully falls
(in essence, catching the box repeatedly as it falls). This will allow you to lay it gently on the bottom box and prevents weird crash physics when the boxes collide.
